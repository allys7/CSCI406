\begin{enumerate}
    \item A certain string processing language allows the programmer to break
    a string into two pieces. It costs $n$ units of time to break a string of n
    characters into two pieces, since this involves copying the old string. A
    programmer wants to break a string into many pieces, and the order in
    which the breaks are made can affect the total amount of time used. For
    example, suppose we wish to break a 20-character string after characters
    3, 8, and 10. If the breaks are made in left-right order, then the first
    break costs 20 units of time, the second break costs 17 units of time,
    and the third break costs 12 units of time, for a total of 49 steps. If
    the breaks are made in right-left order, the first break costs 20 units
    of time, the second break costs 10 units of time, and the third break
    costs 8 units of time, for a total of only 38 steps.
    
    Give a dynamic programming algorithm that takes a list of character positions
    after which to break and determines the cheapest break cost in $O(n^3)$ time.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {\bf Recursive Idea:} Using the example from above, we can imagine
        a scenario in which we break up our string at the 10th index first for a
        cost of 20, leaving us with the remaining 10 characters to be split at
        indexes 8 and 3. We can continue doing this until we have no more
        splits left to make.

        \item {\bf Recursive Relation:} The relation can be defined as follows,
        where \\$cost(i,j)$ is the cost to split a string starting at index $i$ and
        going to $j$.
        
        $cost(i,j) = \min \{$length of substring$ + cost(i,k) + cost(k,j), i < k < j$\}

        For all $j \leq i+1$, $cost(i,j) = 0$ since we cannot split the string
        any further. This is our base case.

        \item {\bf Table:}
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
                $\frac{i}{j}$  & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & $\ldots{}$ & $n-1$ & $n$\\ \hline
                0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                2 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                3 & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                $\ldots{}$ & & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                $n-1$ & & & & & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                $n$ & & & & & & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
                \hline

                \end{tabular}

    \item The traditional world chess championship is a match of 24 games. The
    current champion retains the title in case the match is a tie. Each game
    ends in a win, loss, or draw (tie) where wins count as 1, losses as 0, and
    draws as 1/2. The players take turns playing white and black. White has an
    advantage, because they move first. The champion plays white in the first game.
    They have probabilities $w_w$, $w_d$, and $w_l$ of winning, drawing, and losing
    playing white, and has probabilities $b_w$, $b_d$, and $b_l$ of winning,
    drawing, and losing playing black.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write a recurrence for the probability that the champion retains
        the title. Assume that there are $g$ games left to play in the match
        and that the champion needs to win $i$ games (which may end in a 
        $\frac{1}{2}$)

        \item Based on your recurrence, give a dynamic programming algorithm to
        calculate the championâ€™s probability of retaining the title.

        \item Analyze its running time for an $n$ game match.
    \end{enumerate}
